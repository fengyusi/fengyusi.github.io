Since the start of my PhD studies, I have been dedicating my efforts[5/18] to publish my papers on top-tier conferences in computer architecture (MICRO[0/1], ISCA[0/0], HPCA[1/1], and ASPLOS[1/3]) and security (CCS[0/3], IEEE S&P[0/1], Usenix Security[1/3], and NDSS[0/4]). I also contribute to other good enough conferences in hardware security (e.g., DAC[4/4], DATE[1/1], and CHES). You can find the full publication list from my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rYAO48wAAAAJ&hl=en) and the submission history from [GitHub](https://zhangxin00.github.io/submissions).
